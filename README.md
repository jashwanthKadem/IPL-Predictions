# Indian Premier League (IPL) Predictions

## Project Overview

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a popular Twenty20 cricket league held annually in India. Since its inception in 2007, the IPL has become a significant cultural and economic phenomenon, attracting millions of viewers and advertisers. The project aims to predict match outcomes based on various features such as team performance, toss results, and venue.

## Repository Structure

- **Code:** Contains the Jupyter Notebook (`IPL_Predictions.ipynb`) with the code for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- **Data:** Includes the datasets (`matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv`) used for analysis and modeling.
- **README.md:** Documentation providing an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and insights from the analysis.
- **References:** Citations for resources used in the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need Python installed on your machine along with the required libraries specified in the code. Additionally, ensure you have the IPL dataset downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA section of the project involves analyzing the IPL dataset to gain insights into match outcomes, player performances, and other relevant factors. Visualizations such as bar plots and histograms are utilized to understand the distribution of data and identify patterns.

## Modelling

The Modelling section involves training machine learning models on the IPL dataset to predict match outcomes. Various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and K Nearest Neighbors Classifier are employed and evaluated using accuracy metrics.

## Results

Based on the evaluation of different models, the Random Forest Classifier is selected as the preferred model due to its consistently high training accuracy and improving validation accuracy. This model is capable of achieving a balance between bias and variance, making it suitable for predicting IPL match outcomes.
